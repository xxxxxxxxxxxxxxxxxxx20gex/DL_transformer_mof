# MOFid website

The MOFid code has many utilities, two of which can be run in your web browser:

* The [sbu tool](sbu.html) allows you to deconstruct MOFs into their building blocks and download the analyzed fragments
* The [searchdb tool](searchdb.html) runs queries against the CoRE MOF 2019-ASR [database](http://gregchung.github.io/CoRE-MOFs/) of ~15,000 MOFs

Please note that the tools may require a few minutes to run the analysis after you click "submit."

The main project [GitHub repository](https://github.com/snurr-group/mofid) includes a downloadable C++/Python code, [example CIFs for analysis](https://github.com/snurr-group/mofid/tree/master/Resources/TestCIFs), and credits for third-party software.
